# Azure-Maze-5.0
Kinetic Maze with Azure Kinect and Python Library

Note that this is a Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy project, and it is assumed that this project is running with DPEA pre-configured hardware/software, specifically [RaspberryPiCommon](https://github.com/dpengineering/RaspberryPiCommon), and assocatiated engineering packages. You have probably learned about this already.



## Installation ##
***Note that this is already done on the 'Tuf Gaming' Computer, situated under the circuitry in the Kinetic Maze***
Instructions to install the Azure Kinect SDK are from microsoft, copied here for convinience.

1. Configure the Microsoft Package Repository, and install the Azure Kinect packages (tools, headers, and body tracking):
```
 curl -sSLhttps://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -
 sudo apt-add-repository https://packages.microsoft.com/ubuntu/18.04/prod
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt install k4a-tools
 sudo apt install libk4a1.4-dev
 sudo apt install libk4abt1.1-dev
```
Note: requires OpenGL 4.4 and above, use ```sudo apt install nvidia-driver-455``` to install proper video card driver.

If your device is not being properly recognized by ```k4aviewer``` you may need to set the usb device rules.
To properly set usb device rules:

```
cd /etc/udev/rules.d && sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/develop/scripts/99-k4a.rules
```

To check that your Kinect is properly recognized, run
```
AzureKinectFirmwareTool -q
```


## Azure Kinect on Linux ##
As most Microsoft documentation is windows based, Linux usage will be documented as thoroughly as possible for future use. In general, follow instructions in the Microsoft documentation.

To launch the Azure Kinect Viewer, run `k4aviewer` in the command line.

Joints: x,y,z, measured in mm from the lens of the camera.
